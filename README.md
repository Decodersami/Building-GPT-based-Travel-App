# Building-GPT-based-Travel-App

Welcome to the GPT-based Travel App project repository!

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing a Travel Planner App using the Python LangChain framework and the powerful OpenAI language model, GPT. The app is designed to generate detailed trip itineraries based on user input such as destination, trip type, and number of nights. It utilizes the Streamlit UI framework for a seamless user experience.

## Features:

- **Trip Itinerary Generation**: Utilizing the capabilities of GPT, the app generates comprehensive trip itineraries tailored to the user's preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Streamlit UI provides an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input their travel preferences.
- **LangChain Integration**: LangChain framework is employed to streamline the process of integrating GPT into the app, ensuring efficient language processing.
- **One-Click Deployment**: The app can be easily deployed to the Streamlit Community Cloud with a simple one-click deployment process.

## Project Structure:

- **`app.py`**: Main Python script containing the code for the Travel Planner App.
- **`requirements.txt`**: File listing all the dependencies required to run the app.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed documentation about the project, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- **`images/`**: Directory containing images or screenshots related to the project.

## Getting Started:

To get started with the Travel App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. Input your travel preferences and generate your personalized trip itinerary!
5. (Optional) Deploy the app to the Streamlit Community Cloud by connecting your GitHub repository and initiating a one-click deployment.

## Usage:

- Upon running the app, you will be presented with a user interface where you can input details such as destination, trip type, and duration.
- After submitting your preferences, the app will utilize GPT to generate a customized trip itinerary.
- Review the itinerary and make any necessary adjustments.
- Enjoy your hassle-free trip planning experience!
